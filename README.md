# ML-Random_forest-Algorithm-and-Models
### INTRODUCTION
Random forest, like its name implies, consists of a large number of individual decision trees that operate as an ensemble. Each individual tree in the random forest spits out a class prediction and the class with the most votes becomes our model’s prediction.\
A large number of relatively uncorrelated models (trees) operating as a committee will outperform any of the individual constituent models.
- The reason for this wonderful effect is that the trees protect each other from their individual errors (as long as they don’t constantly all err in the same direction). While some trees may be wrong, many other trees will be right, so as a group the trees are able to move in the correct direction.
